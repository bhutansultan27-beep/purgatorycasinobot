Baccarat is played with eight decks of cards dealt from a shoe, and the objective is to bet on which of two hands—the Player or the Banker—will have a total value closest to nine.
 Number cards (2 through 9) are worth their face value, Aces are worth one point, and 10s and face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth zero points.
 If the total of a hand exceeds nine, only the rightmost digit is used; for example, a total of 15 becomes 5, and a total of 18 becomes 8.

Each hand is initially dealt two cards. The Player hand is acted upon first, followed by the Banker hand. The rules for drawing a third card are fixed and based on the initial totals of both hands.
 If either hand has a total of 8 or 9 with the first two cards, it is called a "natural," and no further cards are drawn.
 If the Player’s total is 0 to 5, they must draw a third card; if the total is 6 or 7, they stand.

The Banker’s decision to draw a third card depends on both their own total and the Player’s third card, if drawn. If the Player stands (with a total of 6 or 7), the Banker draws on totals of 0 to 5 and stands on 6 to 9.
 If the Player draws a third card, the Banker’s action is determined by specific rules based on their own total and the value of the Player’s third card.
 For example, if the Banker has a total of 3, they draw unless the Player’s third card is an 8; if the Banker has a total of 4, they draw if the Player’s third card is 2 through 7, and so on.

Players can place bets on the Player hand, the Banker hand, or a tie.
 Winning bets on the Player or Banker are paid even money, though a 5% commission is typically charged on winning Banker bets in standard Baccarat.
 In No Commission Baccarat, the 5% commission is removed, but a winning Banker hand with a total of 6 results in a push (half the bet is returned), and a side bet called Super 6 pays 12 to 1 when the Banker wins with a total of 6.

Additional optional side bets are available, such as the Dragon Bonus, which pays based on the margin of victory (e.g., 30 to 1 for a 9-point win) or if the hand is a natural winner.
 The Panda 8 side bet pays 25 to 1 when the Player wins with a three-card total of 8.
 The Tie bet pays 8 to 1 if both hands have the same total.
 All side wagers require a corresponding main bet on Player or Banker.
