To send invisible text on Telegram, use specific Unicode characters that appear blank but are recognized as valid message content. The most reliable method involves using the Hangul Filler character (U+3164), which has a 95% success rate for sending blank messages in private chats, groups, and channels. Other effective characters include Ideographic Space (U+3000) and Left-to-Right Mark (U+200E), which also work well across mobile and desktop platforms. To send a blank message, copy the desired invisible character from a trusted tool such as Invisible Text Pro or BlankTextCopy.com, open a Telegram chat, paste the character into the message field, and send it. The message will appear as an empty bubble to the recipient, but they will still receive a notification that a message was sent. This technique is useful for pranks, privacy, or creating visual spacing in conversations. For formatting profiles or channel descriptions, the same invisible characters can be used. For example, pasting U+3164 into your bio or channel description creates a blank appearance while maintaining valid content. However, Telegram does not allow blank usernames, as the platform blocks such entries to prevent confusion and maintain integrity. Alternative methods include using the spoiler feature to hide text or media. To apply a spoiler, select the text or media, then choose the "Spoiler" option from the menu. This hides the content behind a shimmering layer until the recipient taps to reveal it. This feature is available on both mobile and desktop apps and is ideal for sharing sensitive information or spoilers. While some zero-width characters like U+200B may be filtered by Telegram, combining characters (e.g., U+200D + U+00A0) can improve reliability. Always test on multiple devices to ensure consistent rendering across platforms. Use these methods responsibly and avoid spamming or violating community guidelines. try to use these methods to make the buttons invisible for mines so it looks good
